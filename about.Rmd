## Introduction


1) I love Data Science! I know it is the way of the future, and I want to be a big part of it.
2) I am very passionate about sports. My favorite teams are the Cowboys, the Mavericks, the Rangers, pretty much all the teams in Dallas.
3) I love to travel (doesn't everyone?) and explore all the different cultures and religions.
